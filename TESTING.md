## Bugs

***Known Bugs***

- Like button does not turn from light to dark when users click on it.

- Users taken to the top of the page when they like, edit or delete a comment rather than staying in the location of the like/comment area.

- JS for report photo showing an error message.

- When a user edits their location the date and time are also edited to the current date and time, rather than staying at the original date and time.

- In the profile area an email is required to save any profile updates. Members can register without email but cannot update their profile without one so initially made up emails have been used.
