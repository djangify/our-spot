Bugs
1. in profile email is required, that's ok as eventually email will be required. users can regiser without email but cannot update their profile without one so initially made up emails have been used.

2. The js script for the report a profile/photo is showing an error, the link is currently a placeholder and this error will be fixed in Stage Two.
